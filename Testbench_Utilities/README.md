# Testbench Utilities
These utilities aid in creating boilerplate  
testbenches, or code segments that can be easily  
integrated into a larger testbench.  
  
Often these tools have a command line interface,  
but are not super careful with their input checking.  
As such, please follow the readme for the  
tool you choose to use!  
  
Most of these tools can be simply compiled, then  
run like any other program. Ensure the constants  
header (if applicable) is in the same directory  
as the source file of interest during the build  
process.
